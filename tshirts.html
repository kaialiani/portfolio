        <h4>THE TASK</h4>
        <p>
          The task for this assignment was to use different research methods for data collection, followed by an analysis of the collected data and a visual representation of it.
        </p>
        <h4>DESK AND OBSERVATION RESEARCH</h4>
        <p>
          I decided to work on the <i>T-shirt trends among customers</i> theme.
          <br>
          I did some desk research and collected some data from different websites. It was quite satisfying to see how the analyzed sources all led to the same conclusion,
          probably because they were written after detailed data collection as well.
          <br>
          I conducted the observation research by watching a friend browse a clothing online shop.

        <h4>INTERVIEW AND SURVEY RESEARCH</h4>
        <p>
          Both interviews were conducted in an informal setting, the first on a 19 year old woman, and the second one on a 28 year old woman.
          Finally, a survey research was conducted over a group of 51 people with different ages, genders and preferences. The point of the research was to find out peopleâ€™s experiences with T-shirts, starting from the reason why they buy them, or the fabric preferences, sizes, fits etc.
